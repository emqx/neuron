Neuron is an Industrial IoT (IIoT) connectivity server for modern big data and AI/ML technology to leverage the power of Industrial 4.0. It supports one-stop access to dozens of industrial protocols and converts them into MQTT protocol and realize the interconnection between IIoT platforms and various industrial devices.

The following are some important features of Neuron:

- Edge native application with real-time capability to leverage the low latency network of edge side.
- Loosely-coupled modularity [architecture design](https://neugates.io/docs/en/latest/introduction/architecture/architecture.html) for extending more functional services by pluggable modules.
- Support hot plugins that can update device and application modules during runtime.
- Support numerous protocols for industrial devices, including Modbus, OPCUA, Ethernet/IP, IEC104, BACnet and [more](https://neugates.io/docs/en/latest/configuration/south-devices/south-devices.html).
- Support simultaneous connection of a large number of industrial devices with different protocols.
- Combine with the rule engine function provided by [eKuiper](https://www.lfedge.org/projects/ekuiper) to quickly implement rule-based device control or AI/ML analytics.
- Support data access to industrial applications, such as MES or ERP, SCADA, historian and data analytics software via [SparkplugB](https://neugates.io/docs/en/latest/use-cases/use_cases.html#mqtt-sparkplugb-solution) solution.
- Has very low memory footprint, less than 10M, and CPU usage, can run on limited resource hardware like ARM, x86 and RISC-V.
- Support installation of native executable or deployed in containerized enviornment.
- Control industrial devices, and make changes to the parameters and data tags through [HTTP API](https://neugates.io/docs/en/latest/http-api/http-api.html) and [MQTT API](https://neugates.io/docs/en/latest/configuration/north-apps/mqtt/api.html) services.
- Highly integrated with other EMQ products, including [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx), [NanoMQ](https://nanomq.io/), [eKuiper](https://ekuiper.org/).
- The code of the core framework and Modbus, MQTT and eKuiper are licensed under open source LGPLv3. Commercial modules require a [EMQ License](https://neugates.io/docs/en/latest/installation/license-install/license-install.html) to run.

## Get Started

#### Run Neuron using Docker

```
docker run -d --name neuron -p 7000:7000 -p 7001:7001 -p 9081:9081 --privileged=true --restart=always emqx/neuron:latest
```

Next, please follow the [getting started guide](https://neugates.io/docs/en/latest/quick-start/hardware-specifications.html) to tour the Neuron features.

> **Limitations**
>
> Neuron open source edition only includes Modbus and MQTT drivers.
>
> [Apply for a 15-day trial license](https://www.emqx.com/en/apply-licenses/neuron) to load all drivers.
