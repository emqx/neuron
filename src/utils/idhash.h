// We find that we often want to have a list of things listed by a
// numeric ID, which is generally monotonically increasing.  This is
// most often a pipe ID.  To help keep collections of these things
// indexed by their ID (which might start from a very large value),
// we offer a hash table.  The hash table uses open addressing, but
// we use a better probe (taken from Python) to avoid hitting the same
// positions.  Our hash algorithm is just the low order bits, and we
// use table sizes that are powers of two.  Note that hash items
// must be non-NULL.  The table is protected by an internal lock.
